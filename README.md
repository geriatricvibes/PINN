# reflective-curves-summerintern
The present study explores the behaviour of successive light reflections when encountering an unknown reflective curve and a known reflecting line. We aim to gain insights into the characteristics of such reflective curves by analysing the light reflections.

Work done during June - August in Mechanics and Computation Lab, IISc under Dr Ramsharan Rangarajan.
